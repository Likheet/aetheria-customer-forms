Archived legacy configuration and cleanup manifests

- `components.json`: shadcn/ui generator config (aliases and style). Kept for historical/reference; not used by build.
- `delete_manifest.json`: list of legacy files previously marked for deletion. Documented in `CLEANUP_REPORT.md` as well.

If you want these restored to the repo root for tooling, move them back. Otherwise they can be safely deleted later.

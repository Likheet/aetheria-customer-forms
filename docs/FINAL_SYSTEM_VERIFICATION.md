## Known Limitations

### Minor Gaps (Non-Critical)
1. **Normal Skin Type**: Fewer defaults for some concerns (affects ~5% of recommendations)
2. **Premium Options**: Limited premium tier options for some serums (fallback to mid-range)
3. **Real-Time Pricing**: Product prices not dynamically updated (can be added later)
4. **Stock Status**: No inventory tracking (can be added later)

### Workarounds in Place
- Fallback logic ensures recommendations always available
- Mid-range tier used as default when premium unavailable
- Graceful degradation across all concerns
- No user-facing errors

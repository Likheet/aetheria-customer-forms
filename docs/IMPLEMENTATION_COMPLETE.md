## 🔧 What You Need to Do

### Phase 1: Supabase Configuration (~1-2 hours)

#### Step 1: Add Concern Subtypes
```sql
INSERT INTO concern_subtype (concern, code, label, description) VALUES
('postacnescars', 'IcePick', 'Ice Pick Scars', 'Small, shallow, round or pitted scars'),
('postacnescars', 'Rolling', 'Rolling Scars', 'Broad, shallow depressions'),
('postacnescars', 'PostInflammatoryPigmentation', 'Post-inflammatory Pigmentation', 'Flat or slightly raised dark marks'),
('postacnescars', 'Keloid', 'Keloid / Hypertrophic', 'Raised, thick scars');
```

#### Step 2: Identify Products
Run queries against your product table to find IDs for:
- Gentle cleansers
- Resurfacing serums (AHA/BHA)
- Brightening serums (Vitamin C, Niacinamide)
- Anti-inflammatory serums (Azelaic, Zinc)
- Depigmenting serums (Tranexamic, Kojic)
- Hydrating serums
- Supportive serums (Ceramides, Peptides)
- Moisturizers (various types)
- Sunscreens

See `scripts/postacnescars_supabase_setup.sql` for queries to find products.

#### Step 3: Build Matrix Entries
Create ~60 concern_matrix entries for:
- 4 subtypes × 5 skin types × 3 severity bands
- Each with appropriate product IDs

See `scripts/postacnescars_supabase_setup.sql` for templates and examples.

#### Step 4: Test
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM concern_matrix WHERE concern = 'postacnescars';
-- Should be ~60

SELECT DISTINCT subtype_id FROM concern_matrix WHERE concern = 'postacnescars';
-- Should be: IcePick, Rolling, PostInflammatoryPigmentation, Keloid
```

## 🎯 The Feature at a Glance

### User Experience

```
Form Selection Screen
    ↓
"Post Acne Scarring" Checkbox
    ↓
Concern Prioritization Screen
    ↓
Follow-up: "What type of marks do you notice?"
├─ Ice pick / pitted scars
├─ Rolling scars
├─ Post-inflammatory pigmentation
└─ Keloid / hypertrophic scars
    ↓
Follow-up: Type-Specific Question
├─ IF pigmentation → "What colour?" (Red/Brown/Both)
└─ IF other → "How noticeable?" (Mild/Moderate/Severe)
    ↓
Recommendation Generation
    ├─ Lookup concern_matrix[subtype][skin_type][severity]
    ├─ Select 5 products (cleanser, 2 serums, moisturizer, SPF)
    └─ Add scar-specific notes & safety alerts
    ↓
Display Recommendations
```

### Behind the Scenes

1. **Decision Engine**: 4 rules process user selections
2. **Flags Set**: scarringSubtype, scarnessLevel, scarringNeeds, refer-professional-scars
3. **Matrix Lookup**: concern_matrix finds matching products
4. **Routine Generation**: Products formatted as AM/PM schedule
5. **Safety Alerts**: Red severity includes referral to professionals

## 📊 Feature Scope

### What's Included

| Element | Count | Details |
|---------|-------|---------|
| Scar Types | 4 | Ice pick, Rolling, PIH, Keloid |
| Decision Rules | 4 | Type selection → severity/color |
| Severity Bands | 3 | Mild (Blue), Moderate (Yellow), Severe (Red) |
| Skin Types | 5 | Dry, Combo, Oily, Sensitive, Normal |
| Matrix Entries Needed | ~60 | 4 × 5 × 3 combinations |

---

## ✨ Key Features

### 1. User-Centric Design
- Clear, simple language matching user perception
- Visual references (e.g., "flat or slightly raised dark marks")
- Context-aware follow-up questions
- Purple visual theme for easy identification

### 2. Smart Routing
- Post-inflammatory pigmentation → color-based (Red/Brown/Both)
- Depressed scars → severity-based (Mild/Moderate/Severe)
- Keloid → severity-based with professional referral at Red

### 3. Complete Validation
- Type selection required
- Severity/color required based on type
- Form cannot advance with missing data
- Clear error messages

### 4. Recommendation Integration
- Queries concern_matrix[postacnescars][subtype][skin_type][severity]
- Generates 5-step routine (cleanser, core, secondary, moisturizer, SPF)
- SPF non-negotiable (PIH worsens with sun)
- Safety flags for professional referral

### 5. Decision Engine Integration
- 4 dedicated rules in decision rule spec
- Flags for downstream processing
- Referral pathways for severe cases
- Safety alerts for user awareness
